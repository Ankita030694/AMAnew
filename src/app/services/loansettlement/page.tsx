            <strong>What is Loan Settlement?</strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            Loan settlement is a legal process where borrowers negotiate with
            banks and financial institutions to reduce the outstanding loan
            amount and close the loan at a mutually agreed-upon amount. This is
            different from loan closure and is often a last-resort option when a
            borrower is unable to make full repayment.
            <br />
            <br />
